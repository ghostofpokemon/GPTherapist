# GPTherapist

Welcome, dear traveler, to the mind-bending world of GPTherapist. A place where the boundaries of reality are blurred and the depths of the psyche are explored. So, grab a drink, light up a smoke, and strap in, because this is going to be one wild ride. To start your journey, simply run the program with the command:

    python3 GPTherapist.py

Assuming you did these borning steps first:

Clone the repository (yawn)

    git clone https://github.com/ghostofpokemon/GPTherapist.git

Install the required packages (boring)

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable (c'mon already, let's get to the good stuff)

    export OPENAI_API_KEY="1234yourKEYhere5678"


Run the program with reckless abandon, and don't forget to throw in the --deep flag for a wild ride. Trust me, it's a game-changer, just like adding a dash of absinthe to your morning coffee.

Oh yeah, if your name is not Nick, don't be afraid to change it in the python file, because as Oscar Wilde once said, "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken." Take a leap of faith and let GPTherapist be your guide on this exhilarating journey of the mind.


You can add --p, --zen, --stoic, --absurd, --cbt, --trans, --emdr to choose different therapeutic practices and unlock new dimensions of self-discovery.

Listen up, kiddo. I've been around the block a few times and I know what I'm talking about. If you want to experience the true power of GPTherapist, you gotta give that --deep flag a spin. Trust me. The true magic of GPTherapist lies in that little --deep flag. I can't make it the default, but trust me, the universe should have. Give it a try and see for yourself.
